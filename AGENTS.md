# Agent instructions

See the "Style requirements" section of [README.md](README.md) for style rules (Tailwind usage,
`.tsx`/`.ts` split). Kept there instead of duplicated here.

## Verifying changes

Don't start the dev server or drive it with Playwright/chromium-cli to verify a change works.
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm test`, then just tell the user what to manually check (which
screen/tab, what button to click, what result to expect) instead.
