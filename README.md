# TacOps

Fetches your live Tacticus account data, shows your current operations board (as cards or a
table), and uses an integer-programming solver to suggest which characters to send on the rest of
your operations. Ships two ways: a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) desktop app that reads your local
Tacticus credentials automatically, and a website (see [Web version](#web-version)) where you
enter them yourself each visit.

## Tech specs

The desktop app is a Tauri app: a Rust backend (`src-tauri/`) paired with a React/TypeScript
frontend (`src/`), running in the OS's native webview. The website shares that same `src/`
frontend, swapping the Rust backend for a small serverless proxy (see below).

### Backend (`src-tauri/`)

- **Rust** + [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/), using `reqwest` for HTTP and `serde`/`serde_json` for
  (de)serialization.
- `src-tauri/src/credentials.rs` — locates and parses the local Tacticus credentials file (see
  [Credentials](#credentials) below) and exposes it to the frontend as the `find_credentials`
  Tauri command.
- `src-tauri/src/loki.rs` — fetches the full player state (roster, resources,
  expeditions board, ...), exposed as the `fetch_player_data` command. Each outbound request has
  a 20s timeout so a stalled connection fails instead of hanging forever. Device/hardware
  fingerprint fields are intentionally left as generic fake values.
- **macOS and Windows** — credential auto-discovery is implemented for both. Other platforms
  (e.g. Linux) aren't implemented.

### Frontend (`src/`)

- **React 19** + **TypeScript**, built with **Vite**, styled with **Tailwind CSS v4**
  (`@tailwindcss/vite`, CSS-first config — no `tailwind.config.js`).
- `src/main.tsx` / `src/App.tsx` — entry point and top-level layout. `GO` fetches player data
  (each RPC has its own timeout plus a countdown spinner) and renders the board immediately, then
  runs the assignment solver in a background Web Worker so the UI never blocks — the board is
  shown but disabled, under its own spinner overlay, until a suggestion (or a clear failure
  message) comes back. The environment switcher, the table view, and the Characters/Machines of
  War tabs are hidden by default (debug-only) — press "8" to reveal them.
- `src/components/` — presentational `.tsx` components (tables, cards, icon helpers, tabs,
  toggles, status indicators).
- `src/api/` — Tauri `invoke` calls (wrapped with a per-call timeout, see `invoke-with-timeout.ts`)
  and shared types.
- `src/board/board-solver.ts` — the suggested-assignment solver: builds a mixed-integer program
  (via `javascript-lp-solver`) over the open boards and available roster, solved in sequential
  lexicographic passes (bonus-resource priority, then XP earned, then boards run, then minimizing
  rank overkill) - each pass locks in the previous one's optimum before optimizing the next tier.
  Runs inside `board-solver.worker.ts` (a Web Worker) so a hard instance can't freeze the UI; each
  pass is time-boxed and checked for integrality, falling back to the last fully-valid pass (with
  a warning) or, if nothing usable was found at all, clearing the suggestions and telling the user
  to fill that board in manually.
- `src/board/`, `src/characters/`, `src/rank/`, `src/rarity/`, `src/progression/`, `src/factions/`
  — pure `.ts` logic: decoding raw save-data fields (`progressionIndex`, `rank`, ...) into
  domain enums, resolving game-data ids (traits, damage profiles, factions, portraits, ...) to
  the matching asset URL, and view-model functions that turn raw API data into plain objects
  ready for a component to render.
- `src/assets/` — game data (`character-data.json`, `ability-data.json`, `mow-data.json`,
  `operations-data.json` for human-readable operation names) and icon/portrait images, checked
  into the repo.

### Building and running

```sh
npm install          # install frontend deps (also fetches the Rust deps on first Tauri run)
npm run tauri dev     # run the app in dev mode (hot-reloading webview + Tauri backend)
npm run tauri build   # produce a release build/installer
```

`npm run dev` / `npm run build` alone only run the Vite frontend (useful for quick UI iteration or
`tsc`/build verification) — they don't start the Tauri window or backend commands, so `find_credentials`
and `fetch_player_data` won't be available; use the `tauri` scripts above to run the full app.

### Building for distribution

`npm run tauri build` produces a native installer for whatever OS you run it on — e.g. on macOS
that's `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/tacops.app` and a `.dmg`; on Windows it's a `.msi`
and an NSIS `.exe` under the equivalent `bundle/` folders. It only builds for the host you're
running it on — Tauri doesn't support cross-compiling to another OS without extra toolchains, and
that path is fragile enough that it isn't set up here.

To get a build for the *other* OS without owning that hardware, use the GitHub Actions workflows:
[`.github/workflows/build-macos.yml`](.github/workflows/build-macos.yml) and
[`.github/workflows/build-windows.yml`](.github/workflows/build-windows.yml). Both build natively
on GitHub-hosted runners (macOS builds both `aarch64` and `x86_64` as separate installers, Windows
builds the native MSI/NSIS installers) and run one of two ways:

- **Publish a GitHub Release** through the normal UI (any tag, any notes) — both workflows fire
  automatically and attach their installers directly to that release once they finish building.
- **Run a workflow manually** from the Actions tab — builds the same way, but creates/updates its
  own separate draft release (tag `app-v<version>`) instead of targeting one you've already
  published.

### Credentials

TacOps doesn't manage login — it reads the credentials the actual Tacticus game client already
wrote to disk. Which file it reads depends on the OS:

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/com.snowprintstudios.tacticus/live-loki_user_data.json` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Snowprint\Warhammer 40,000_ Tacticus\live-loki_user_data.json` |

This file needs at least `userId` and `clientSecret`; `snowId` is used when present.

## Web version

TacOps also ships as a website, sharing the same `src/` React codebase as the desktop app rather
than being a separate project - `isTauri()` (`@tauri-apps/api/core`) picks the transport at
runtime:

- **Credentials**: the desktop app auto-discovers them from disk (see above); the website instead
  shows a `userId`/`clientSecret` form above the `GO` button (`App.tsx`), with `autoComplete`
  attributes set so the browser's own password manager can offer to remember them. Nothing is
  stored server-side - each visit starts blank unless the browser fills it in.
- **Fetching player data**: the desktop app calls `fetch_player_data` in `src-tauri/src/loki.rs`
  directly; a browser can't do that itself (the game's API doesn't send CORS headers), so the
  website instead calls a same-origin route at `/api/fetch-player-data`, handled by the Worker
  script in `worker/index.ts` (backed by `worker/loki-client.ts`) that replays the identical
  APP_START → CONNECT → GET_PLAYER handshake server-side and returns the same JSON shape - kept in
  sync with `loki.rs` by hand, since Tauri commands and a Cloudflare Worker can't share Rust/TS
  code directly.
- **Hosting**: a [Cloudflare Worker with static assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/)
  serves both the built frontend (`dist/`, via the `[assets]` block in `wrangler.toml`) and the
  proxy (`worker/index.ts`) from one project, one domain - Cloudflare serves a matching static
  file first for any request, falling through to the Worker script only for `/api/fetch-player-data`,
  so the frontend's calls to its own proxy are same-origin and need no CORS configuration of their
  own. The Cloudflare dashboard's own GitHub integration (Workers & Pages → Create application →
  connect the repo) auto-deploys on every push to `master`, so there's no separate GitHub Actions
  workflow for this - build command `npm run build`, deploy command `npx wrangler deploy`. No
  environment variables or secrets need to be configured - the proxy is stateless.
- **Local dev**: `npm run worker:dev` builds the frontend and runs `wrangler dev`, serving the
  built assets and `/api/fetch-player-data` together locally (no Vite hot-reload in this mode -
  use plain `npm run dev` for frontend-only iteration).

## Style requirements

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — this section is the canonical source; AGENTS.md just points here so
the rules only live in one place.

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling instead of hand-written stylesheets, unless there's a really good
  reason not to.
- Layout/rendering code goes in `.tsx` files. Logic goes in `.ts` files. No exceptions.
